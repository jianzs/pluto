fix(deducer): failed to bundle the dependencies of pyright-internal when publishing pyright-deducer

Before, we used the `bundleDependencies` option to bundle the dependencies of `pyright-internal` when publishing `pyright-deducer`. However, it failed to include the dependencies of `pyright-internal` when publishing `pyright-deducer`. So, we opted to utilize webpack to bundle the entire `pyright-deducer` package along with all its dependencies, including `pyright-internal` and its dependencies.

Because webpack bundles each dependency of `pyright-deducer` into a single file, if we attempt to verify whether an instance of PyrightDeducer from `pyright-deducer` is an instance of Deducer from `@plutolang/base`, we will receive a false result. Therefore, we should check for the existence of the `deduce` method instead.
