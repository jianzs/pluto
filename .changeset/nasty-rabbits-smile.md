feat: closure mode support, architecture reference structure enhancements, user custom function resource support

- Closure Mode Support: Comprehensive modifications have been made to add support for closure mode. These include updates to the SDK for various cloud platforms, enhancing the deducer's closure analysis capabilities, incorporating closure import statements in the generated IaC code, and more.

- Architectural Reference Structure Enhancements: The architectural reference structure now includes closure items. The CLI, generator, and deducer have been adjusted to align with the updated architectural reference structure.

- User Custom Function Resource: Support has been added for user custom function resources on Alicloud, AWS, and Kubernetes.

- Documentation Updates: The documentation has been revised to reflect these changes.
